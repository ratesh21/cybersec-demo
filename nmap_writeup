## Executive summary
A quick service/version scan of `scanme.nmap.org` revealed a small set of reachable services. HTTP (port **80**) is open and served by **Apache httpd 2.4.7 (Ubuntu)**. Most other TCP ports are filtered (no response) and several common service ports (FTP, DNS, HTTPS) are closed. The primary area of interest is the exposed HTTP service and its reported version — verify and patch as appropriate. No intrusive testing or exploitation was performed.
